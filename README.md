# Coast

The purpose of this project is to collect some data provided by www.alphavantage.co and find the greatest relative span.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project was written in Python3.7. 

So you will need Python3.7, pip(python3.7) and SQLite3 installed in your machine.

### Installing

If you have all prerequisites, you will be able to install the dependencies or if you prefer to use Docker read the next session.

First enter in the directory of the project.

To install the dependencies execute:

```
pip install -r requirementes.txt
```

After that, open the default.toml and modify the level log which you prefer and add the token of www.alphavantage.co.

The file you will be something like:

```
[logging]
level = "DEBUG"

[api]
token = "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
```

If you would like to run migrations, you can set an enviroment variable with value "yes"

```
export RUN_MIGRATIONS="yes"
```

If you don't need or don't want to reset the tables, you don't need to set this variable, the sqlite database with this project already have the necessary tables.

Now, you will be able to execute the project. Just execute:

```
python coast.py
```

### Docker

docker run -itd -p 5000:5000 --name coast coast:latest
```
